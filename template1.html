cellParagrpah text in first doc:§ 2. Scania reserves the right to postpone the delivery of the goods or the provision of the services until full payment has been received.
§ 3. A complaint about a delay in the implementation of the agreement by Scania and/or the invoice does not grant the Customer the right to suspend its payments.
§ 4. Complaints about invoices must be submitted to Scania in writing within 14 days after the invoice date.
If nothing is reported, the Customer is deemed to have accepted the invoice as correct.
§ 5. If the Customer wishes to make use of external funding, it is up to the Customer to complete all necessary formalities. The indication “payment by/subject to funding”, or any other equivalent statement in a quotation, offer, purchase order or agreement, is for information purposes only and does not imply that the agreement is concluded under the suspensive condition of the allocation of funding to the Customer.
Furthermore, the Customer is not entitled to termination of the agreement in the event of any refusal of funding.
§ 6. If the Customer is in default or fails to fulfil one or more of its obligations, all reasonable costs made for obtaining compensation through extra-judicial means will be paid by the Customer. The Customer will owe Scania at least 15% of the amount due, with a minimum of EUR 175 (exclusive of VAT). If Scania can reasonably prove to have incurred higher costs, than these will also be eligible for compensation.
§ 7. The Customer is obligated to reimburse all reasonable costs made by Scania related to legal proceedings in which the Customer is found to be wholly or largely at fault. These costs will in any event include the costs of external experts, bailiffs and lawyers, even if these costs exceed the amount allocated by the Court.
§ 8. All claims made by Scania will be due immediately when the Customer files for bankruptcy, suspension of payments and liquidation, or when the Customer dies, as well as all circumstances in which Scania’s claim to recover damage may be jeopardized. In such cases, Scania is entitled to discontinue all supplies and/or activities and to recover or remove delivered company assets, goods and parts, without any Court intervention.
§ 9. The Customer waives any right to settle, discount, suspension and/or debt comparison. 
§ 10. Payments made shall first serve for the deduction of costs, followed by the (set amount) compensation, then the interest rates and then the principal sum.
Article 8 Retention of title
§ 1. Scania retains ownership of the goods delivered and services provided to the Customer until full payment has been received. Scania also retains ownership of these goods until any claim for damages due to the Customer’s failure to comply with the agreements referred to in the first sentence, has been paid.
§ 2. As long as the ownership of the delivered goods has not been passed onto the Customer, the Customer may not pledge, sell or actually deliver the goods (whether or not during the ordinary course of business) or grant any other right to any other third party. This Article seeks to have effects of property law.
Notwithstanding the retention of title mentioned above, the risks are transferred to the Customer at the time of delivery.
§ 3. The Customer is obligated to keep the goods delivered under retention of title with the appropriate care and recognizable as property of Scania. The Customer is also obligated to take out an insurance against fire and water damage and theft. At Scania’s first request, the Customer will provide Scania with all the information needed to determine whether the Customer has fulfilled these obligations. Should it be established that the customer has not fulfilled these obligations, or if Scania suspects that the customer has not fulfilled these obligations, Scania is entitled to take out an insurance against fire and water damage and theft at the expense of the Customer.
§ 4. If the Customer fails to comply with its payment obligation towards Scania, or if Scania has valid reasons to believe that the Customer will fail to fulfil this obligation, Scania is authorised to repossess the goods delivered under retention of title. If the goods delivered by Scania have already been installed in a business belonging to the Customer, at first request of Scania, the Customer will disassemble the sold items and make them available to Scania, without prejudice to Scania’s right to perform such disassembly itself. The costs of this disassembly will be borne by the Customer.
§ 5. In the event of repossession, the Customer is obligated to provide all cooperation, under penalty of a fine of 10% per day of the amount owned by the Customer, with a minimum of EUR 175 per day.
Article 9 Liability
§ 1. If Scania (attributably) fails to meet its obligations regarding the delivery of goods and Scania is required to provide a warranty, under no circumstances is it obligated to do any more than it has undertaken to do pursuant to the warranty conditions.
§ 2. If Scania (attributably) fails to provide any services/activities, it is in no case obligated to do any more than take care of the repair work at no charge. If Scania provides any free advice, it will never be liable for damages resulting from inaccuracies in such advice.
§ 3. The Customer fully indemnifies Scania against claims brought by third parties against Scania in respect of goods delivered to the Customer or work performed for the Customer.
§ 4. Scania will never be liable for indirect and consequential damages, such as, but not limited to, losses suffered, loss of profits and/or stagnation damages.
§ 5. Scania’s liability, subject to the provisions of these terms and conditions, irrespective of the basis of such liability, is limited in all cases to such amount as is paid out by its liability insurer in that matter, and alternatively, if the insurer does not pay, is limited to EUR 11,350 per event.
§ 6. If Scania declines to invoke liability-limiting clauses, this will be done expressly in writing, be nonbinding and it will only apply to that particular case without any further acknowledgement.
§ 7. Only if the damage is the result of intentional or gross negligence of Scania or its management, will the limitations of Scania’s liability set out in these terms and conditions not apply.
§ 8. Any claim against Scania will be subject to a limitation period of one year and will expire after two years, starting from the date of establishing the claim.
Article 10 Miscellaneous
§ 1. If any provision of these terms and conditions is declared null and void or rendered invalid, the other provisions of these terms and conditions will remain in full force. The parties undertake to replace any null, invalid or unenforceable clause with a valid and enforceable clause which most closely approximates the parties’ intention.
§ 2. Scania’s failure to invoke the rights that are due to it, shall never be constituted as a waiver of such rights.
§ 3. All personal information will be used exclusively by Scania and/or its group companies and will never be disclosed to third parties, except when required for payment transactions and delivery of the order. Scania and its group companies respect the privacy of the Customer and will ensure that the Customer’s personal information is treated confidentially. The Customer hereby gives permission to use its information to inform the Customer about product and service offers from Scania, as well as for research, service and development purposes and to continue the development, improvement and offering of products of Scania and its group companies, everything in the broadest sense of the word.
Article 11 Applicable law and competent court
§ 1. Any legal relationship between Scania and the Customer is exclusively governed by Dutch law.
Applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly ruled out.
§ 2. If a dispute arises between the parties about the performance of any agreement governed by these terms and conditions, about (the applicability of) these terms and conditions, or about any other legal relationship between them, they will seek to reach an agreement in mutual consultation. If, for any reasons, the parties fail to reach an agreement, the dispute will be settled by the competent court in Antwerpen, without prejudice to Scania’s right to bring the dispute before the court who would be competent without this clause.

As long as the ownership of the delivered goods has not been passed onto the Customer, the Customer may not pledge, sell or actually deliver the goods (whether or not during the ordinary course of business) or grant any other right to any other third party. This Article seeks to have effects of property law.
Notwithstanding the retention of title mentioned above, the risks are transferred to the Customer at the time of delivery.
§ 3. The Customer is obligated to keep the goods delivered under retention of title with the appropriate care and recognizable as property of Scania. The Customer is also obligated to take out an insurance against fire and water damage and theft. At Scania’s first request, the Customer will provide Scania with all the information needed to determine whether the Customer has fulfilled these obligations. Should it be established that the customer has not fulfilled these obligations, or if Scania suspects that the customer has not fulfilled these obligations, Scania is entitled to take out an insurance against fire and water damage and theft at the expense of the Customer.
§ 4. If the Customer fails to comply with its payment obligation towards Scania, or if Scania has valid reasons to believe that the Customer will fail to fulfil this obligation, Scania is authorised to repossess the goods delivered under retention of title. If the goods delivered by Scania have already been installed in a business belonging to the Customer, at first request of Scania, the Customer will disassemble the sold items and make them available to Scania, without prejudice to Scania’s right to perform such disassembly itself. The costs of this disassembly will be borne by the Customer.
§ 5. In the event of repossession, the Customer is obligated to provide all cooperation, under penalty of a fine of 10% per day of the amount owned by the Customer, with a minimum of EUR 175 per day.
Article 9 Liability
§ 1. If Scania (attributably) fails to meet its obligations regarding the delivery of goods and Scania is required to provide a warranty, under no circumstances is it obligated to do any more than it has undertaken to do pursuant to the warranty conditions.
§ 2. If Scania (attributably) fails to provide any services/activities, it is in no case obligated to do any more than take care of the repair work at no charge. If Scania provides any free advice, it will never be liable for damages resulting from inaccuracies in such advice.
§ 3. The Customer fully indemnifies Scania against claims brought by third parties against Scania in respect of goods delivered to the Customer or work performed for the Customer.
§ 4. Scania will never be liable for indirect and consequential damages, such as, but not limited to, losses suffered, loss of profits and/or stagnation damages.
§ 5. Scania’s liability, subject to the provisions of these terms and conditions, irrespective of the basis of such liability, is limited in all cases to such amount as is paid out by its liability insurer in that matter, and alternatively, if the insurer does not pay, is limited to EUR 11,350 per event.
§ 6. If Scania declines to invoke liability-limiting clauses, this will be done expressly in writing, be nonbinding and it will only apply to that particular case without any further acknowledgement.
§ 7. Only if the damage is the result of intentional or gross negligence of Scania or its management, will the limitations of Scania’s liability set out in these terms and conditions not apply.
§ 8. Any claim against Scania will be subject to a limitation period of one year and will expire after two years, starting from the date of establishing the claim.
Article 10 Miscellaneous
§ 1. If any provision of these terms and conditions is declared null and void or rendered invalid, the other provisions of these terms and conditions will remain in full force. The parties undertake to replace any null, invalid or unenforceable clause with a valid and enforceable clause which most closely approximates the parties’ intention.
§ 2. Scania’s failure to invoke the rights that are due to it, shall never be constituted as a waiver of such rights.
§ 3. All personal information will be used exclusively by Scania and/or its group companies and will never be disclosed to third parties, except when required for payment transactions and delivery of the order. Scania and its group companies respect the privacy of the Customer and will ensure that the Customer’s personal information is treated confidentially. The Customer hereby gives permission to use its information to inform the Customer about product and service offers from Scania, as well as for research, service and development purposes and to continue the development, improvement and offering of products of Scania and its group companies, everything in the broadest sense of the word.
Article 11 Applicable law and competent court
§ 1. Any legal relationship between Scania and the Customer is exclusively governed by Dutch law.
Applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly ruled out.
§ 2. If a dispute arises between the parties about the performance of any agreement governed by these terms and conditions, about (the applicability of) these terms and conditions, or about any other legal relationship between them, they will seek to reach an agreement in mutual consultation. If, for any reasons, the parties fail to reach an agreement, the dispute will be settled by the competent court in Antwerpen, without prejudice to Scania’s right to bring the dispute before the court who would be competent without this clause.
